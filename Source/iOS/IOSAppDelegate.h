    IOSAppDelegate.h
    Created: 22 Sep 2020

    This is an UIApplicationDelegate for running JUCE and Flutter in an iOS app.
      https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate
    It deals with setting the main UIWindow with the Flutter View, read here:
      https://flutter.dev/docs/development/add-to-app/ios/add-flutter-screen?tab=vc-objective-c-tab
    It also cares for JUCE, see:
      JUCE/modules/juce_events/messages/juce_Initialisation.h
 
    In the PROJUCER export settings, set binary build dir for the ios targets to $(BUILD_DIR)/$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME), see
      https://forum.juce.com/t/solved-cocoapods-and-introjucer-generated-projects-linker-error-react-native/16426
    
    This imports Flutter.h, so after exporting the project with PROJUCER, run
      "pod install" in terminal in Builds/iOS directory and open / compile the
      file "JucyFluttering.xcworkspace" (not .xcpodeproj).
